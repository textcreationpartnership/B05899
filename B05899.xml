            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE SNARE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AS I along the <hi>Mall</hi> one Evening walk'd,</l>
               <l>I heard two Voices, but ſaw none that talk'd;</l>
               <l>It being dusk, I endeavour'd to draw near,</l>
               <l>Being Curious in theſe times ſome News to hear:</l>
               <l>When liſtening earneſtly I underſtood</l>
               <l>That they were Perſons near Ally'd in Blood.</l>
               <l>How their Diſcourſe began, I cann't declare,</l>
               <l>But this that follows, is what I did hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi> When I your Name and Place did bear,</l>
               <l>I ſought the Peoples Love before their Fear,</l>
               <l>And by that Means both Fear and Love I got,</l>
               <l>From the Rich Ermin to the Ruſſet Coat:</l>
               <l>And now you find what I have oft declared.</l>
               <l>The Vulgar muſt be Loved, or they'll be Fear'd:</l>
               <l>They'll Suffer long, and much, but once Enraged,</l>
               <l>Devouring Flames more eaſie are Aſſwag'd.</l>
               <l>When urg'd paſt Reaſon, they'll no Reaſon hear,</l>
               <l>Nor Credit ought, that you can ſay, or ſwear.</l>
               <l>Your Word once broke, none values it at all,</l>
               <l>Though Heav'n and Earth for Witneſſes you call:</l>
               <l>Had you, like me, kept on the Vizor ſtill,</l>
               <l>You with more Eaſe had wrought 'em to your Will;</l>
               <l>But when the Game is by the Huntſman Scar'd,</l>
               <l>'Twere a Folly, if they ſhould Neglect their Guard.</l>
               <l>You know the <hi>Iriſh</hi> I at diſtance kept,</l>
               <l>Who in an Inſtant to your Boſom crept.</l>
               <l>I ſoon diſcern'd how 'gainſt the Hair it went</l>
               <l>For <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> to ſit in Parliament.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They are obnoxious in their Converſation,</l>
               <l>And ought to be Confin'd to their own Nation;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Their Honour is proportion'd to their Sence,</l>
                  <l>Their Language, Lying, Oaths and Impudence,</l>
                  <l>With which Accompliſhments they ſerve their Prince.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>For if they are <hi>Iriſh,</hi> 't muſt be underſtood,</l>
               <l>They're qualified for all that's Great and Good:</l>
               <l>Which with much eaſe all ſober Men may gather,</l>
               <l>By the Succeſs you've had ſince they came hither.</l>
               <l>But if you'd clear the Miſts before your Eyes,</l>
               <l>You'd ſee how you are made their Prey and Prize,</l>
               <l>Swallowing with haſte thoſe poiſon'd Notions down,</l>
               <l>Of Prieſts and <hi>Mac</hi>'s and Sycophants o'th' Gown,</l>
               <l>While your poor Flocks for ſafety from you fly,</l>
               <l>And in your Boſom Woolves and Tygers lie.</l>
               <l>When to defend their Liberty and Laws,</l>
               <l>A needful Sword Unwillingly each draws;</l>
               <l>And Neighbouring Princes to their Succors come,</l>
               <l>Knowing too well the Cruelties of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               </l>

               <l>Againſt their yet intended Maſſacre,</l>
               <l>Their Cauldrons, Gridirons, Bridles, Spits and Swords,</l>
               <l>Envenom'd Shirts, and their Tormenting Cords,</l>
               <l>Their Boots of Boyling Oyl, Tortures and Racks,</l>
               <l>Their barbarous Prieſts, and the more barbarous <hi>Mac</hi>'s,</l>
               <l>Their Half-Crown Cut-Throats kept three Years in pay</l>
               <l>To help to bear the Burden of the Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now to be baulk'd in ſuch an Expectation,</l>

               <l>Who all Abominate ſuch Horrid Courſes.</l>
               <l>Now to be Queſtion'd for the things you've Acted,</l>
               <l>Wou'd make a much more Solid Man Diſtracted;</l>
               <l>And after all for a continual Curſe,</l>
               <l>To be By one damn'd Fury Tortur'd worſe.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Now thoſe who in your blindfold Counſels fate,</l>
               <l>May take a Proſpect of their Future State,</l>

               <l>Nay, they'd forſake you, and to t'ther run,</l>
               <l>But that of all the World, 'tis him they'd ſhun:</l>
               <l>They hang about you ſtill with fainting Hopes,</l>
